# Maximus Alvir — Sports Analytics Portfolio

Welcome! I'm a Sports Analytics graduate major at Syracuse University passionate about applying data science to football strategy and roster building. Here's a look at my most impactful projects:

---

## 💸 Running Back Value & Role Classification
- Used k-means clustering on usage, efficiency, and game context metrics.
- Created a normalized Value Score and contract-adjusted rankings.
- Visualized role-based archetypes and identified market inefficiencies.
- Compared 2025 Draftees to NFL veterans based off clustering and Euclidean distance

## 📈 Spread Formation Tactical Analysis Model 
- Conducted a full-cycle analytics project using nflfastR and Sharp Football data to evaluate how spread 
formations impact success on short yardage situations 
- Engineered features such as spread_usage_pct, play type, formation, and previous play success; built 
logistic regression models to predict red zone touchdown probability 
- Visualized teams over/underperformance by comparing predicted vs. actual red zone TD rates

## 🏀 Overperformers and Outliers: A Machine Learning Study of NBA Lineup Success
 - Built an autoencoder neural network to compress lineup statistics into 2D synergy profiles, revealing stylistic similarities and chemistry patterns across 2024–25 NBA lineups
 - Used XGBoost to predict offensive rating and calculated performance residuals to flag lineups outperforming or underperforming their statistical profile
 - Visualized synergy-performance interactions to identify which lineups teams should prioritize based on spacing, ball movement, rim pressure, and turnover control

## 🏈 Fantasy Football Performance Modeling
- Built weekly player projection models using R and Python (SARIMAX, Random Forest, Bayesian Inference).
- Modeled game script and opponent strength for robust predictive outputs.
- Designed visuals for accuracy comparison and decision support.
