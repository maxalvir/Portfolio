# Maximus Alvir ‚Äî Sports Analytics Portfolio

Welcome! I'm a Sports Analytics major at Syracuse University passionate about applying data science to football strategy and roster building. Here's a look at my most impactful projects:

---

## üí∏ Running Back Value & Role Classification
- Used k-means clustering on usage, efficiency, and game context metrics.
- Created a normalized Value Score and contract-adjusted rankings.
- Visualized role-based archetypes and identified market inefficiencies.
- Compared 2025 Draftees to NFL veterans based off clustering and Euclidean distance

## üìà Spread Formation Tactical Analysis Model 
- Conducted a full-cycle analytics project using nflfastR and Sharp Football data to evaluate how spread 
formations impact success on short yardage situations 
- Engineered features such as spread_usage_pct, play type, formation, and previous play success; built 
logistic regression models to predict red zone touchdown probability 
- Visualized teams over/underperformance by comparing predicted vs. actual red zone TD rates
